Open source software for the Pillar Codi Robot

Coming up with a new firmware for this device is worth the time for a few reasons:

  1. These devices are cheap and readily available on ebay
  2. They look like a Reddit avatar
  3. They have all the right peripherals to make a cool IoT device
  4. The company is unresponsive and maybe out of business

Here's what I've got so far:

I have disassembled the toy and found what hardware it is using:

  Main processor: XR871ET - Datasheets | SDK
  Audio processor: A101
  Bluetooth(?): JL AS20AP24150
  Storage: GD25Q64C - Datasheet
